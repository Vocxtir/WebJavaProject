					<h3>Learning Is Important</h3>

					<p>Larth was hopeful. He had been healthy all his life, partly, he believed, because he had always 
been careful to show respect to the numina he encountered on his journeys.
          Respecting the numina was important. The numen of the river could suck a man under and drown him. The numen 
of a tree could trip a man with its roots, or drop a rotten branch on his head. Rocks could give way 
underfoot, chuckling with amusement at their own treachery. Even the sky, with a roar of fury, sometimes sent 
down fingers of fire that could roast a man like a rabbit on a spit, or worse, leave him alive but robbed of 
his senses. Larth had heard that the earth itself could open and swallow a man; though he had never actually 
seen such a thing, he nevertheless performed a ritual each morning, asking the earthâ€™s permission before he 
went striding across it.
